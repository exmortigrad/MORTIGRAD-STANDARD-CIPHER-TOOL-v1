This program will encode and decode any valid characters for the MORTIGRAD Standard cipher language.
ENCODE: Enter your word or phrase normally, as long as it's in english and spelled correctly, then punctuation and spaces won't matter.
DECODE: Enter a MORTIGRAD Standard cipher and it will output the english translation, though without spaces currently. Invalid numbers will not print.
Please report any bugs or issues with encoding/decoding.
